The Game

GAME CHARACTERISTICS
Volleyball is a sport played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net. There are different
versions available for specific circumstances in order to offer the versatility of the game to
everyone.
The object of the game is to send the ball over the net in order to ground it on the opponent’s
court, and to prevent the same effort by the opponent. The team has three hits for returning the
ball (in addition to the block contact).
The ball is put in play with a service: hit by the server over the net to the opponents. The rally
continues until the ball is grounded on the playing court, goes “out” or a team fails to return it
properly.
In Volleyball, the team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving
team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position
clockwise.

PHILOSOPHY OF RULES AND REFEREEING
INTRODUCTION
Volleyball is one of the most successful and popular, competitive, and recreational sports in the
world. It is fast, it is exciting, and the action is explosive. Yet volleyball comprises several crucial
overlapping elements whose complimentary interactions render it unique amongst rally games.

In recent years the FIVB has made great strides in adapting the game to a modern audience.
This text is aimed at a broad Volleyball public - players, coaches, referees, spectators,
commentators for the following reasons:
- understanding the rules better, allows better play - coaches can create better team
structure and tactics, allowing players full rein to display their skills
- understanding the relationship between rules allows officials to make better decisions
This introduction at first focuses on Volleyball as a competitive sport, before setting out to identify
the main qualities required for successful refereeing.
VOLLEYBALL IS A COMPETITIVE SPORT
Competition taps latent strengths. It exhibits the best of ability, spirit, creativity, and aesthetics.
The rules are structured to allow all of these qualities. With a few exceptions, Volleyball allows all
players to operate both at the net (in attack) and in the back of the court (to defend or serve).
William Morgan, the game’s creator, would still recognize it because volleyball has retained
certain distinctive and essential elements over the years. Some of these it shares with other net/
ball/ racquet games:
-

service
rotation (taking turns to serve)
attack
defence

Volleyball is, however, unique amongst net games in insisting that the ball is in constant flight – a
“flying ball” – and by allowing each team a degree of internal passing before the ball must be
returned to the opponents.
The introduction of a specialist defensive player – the Libero – has moved the game forward in
terms of rally length and multi-phase play. Modifications to the service rule have changed the act
of service from simply a means of putting the ball in play to an offensive weapon.

-12-

The concept of rotation is entrenched to allow for all-round athletes. The rules on player positions
must permit teams to have flexibility and to create interesting developments in tactics.
Competitors use this framework to contest techniques, tactics, and power. The framework also
allows players a freedom of expression to enthuse spectators and viewers.
And the image of volleyball is increasingly a good one.
THE REFEREE WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK
The essence of a good official lies in the concept of fairness and consistency:
- to be fair to every participant
- to be viewed as fair by the spectators
This demands a huge element of trust – the referee must be trusted to allow the players to
entertain:
- by being accurate in his/her judgement
- by understanding why the rule is written
- by being an efficient organizer
- by allowing the competition to flow and by directing it to a conclusion
- by being an educator – using the rules to penalize the unfair or admonish the impolite
- by promoting the game – that is, by allowing the spectacular elements in the game to
shine and the best players to do what they do best: entertain the public.
Finally, we can say that a good referee will use the rules to make the competition a fulfilling
experience for all concerned.
To those who have read so far, view the Rules which follow as the current state of development
of a great game, but keep in mind why these preceding few paragraphs may be of equal
importance to you in your own position within the sport.

Get involved!
Keep the ball flying!
Understand the game!

are drawn inside the dimensions of the playing court.

1.3.3

Centre line
The axis of the centre line divides the playing court into two equal courts measuring 9
X 9 m each; however, the entire width of the line is considered to belong to both courts
equally. This line extends beneath the net from side line to side line.

1.3.4

Attack line
On each court, an attack line whose rear edge is drawn 3 m back from the axis of the
centre line, marks the front zone.

-14-

1.4

ZONES AND AREAS

1.4.1

Front zone
On each court the front zone is limited by the axis of the centre line and the rear edge
of the attack line.
The front zone is considered to extend beyond the sidelines to the end of the free
zone.

1.4.2

Service zone
The service zone is a 9 m wide area behind each end line.
It is laterally limited by two short lines, each 15 cm long, drawn 20 cm behind the end
line as an extension of the sidelines. Both short lines are included in the width of the
service zone.
In depth, the service zone extends to the end of the free zone.

1.4.3

Substitution zone
The substitution zone is limited by the extension of both attack lines up to the scorer’s
table.

1.4.4

Libero Replacement Zone
The Libero Replacement Zone is part of the free zone on the side of the team benches,
limited by the extension of the attack line up to the end line.

1.4.5

Warm-up area
The warm-up areas, sized approximately 3 X 3 m, are located in both of the bench-side
corners, outside the free zone, where they will not obstruct the view of spectators, or
alternatively behind the team bench, where the tribune starts above 2.5 m from the
court surface. (Diagram 1a, 1b).

1.5

TEMPERATURE
The minimum temperature shall not be below 10° C (50° F).

1.6

LIGHTING
The lighting on the playing area should be 1000 to 1500 lux measured at 1 m above
the surface of the playing area.

2.

NET AND POSTS (Diagram 3)

2.1

HEIGHT OF THE NET

2.1.1

Placed vertically over the centre line, there is a net whose top is set at the height of
2.43 m for men and 2.24 m for women.
Volleyball Canada Youth Competition - 15/16 & under men - 2.35m, 15 & under
women - 2.20m, 16 & under women - 2.24m, 14 & under men - 2.20m, 14 & under
women - 2.15m.

2.1.2

Its height is measured from the centre of the playing court. The net height (over the two
side lines) must be exactly the same and must not exceed the official height by more
than 2 cm.
-15-

2.2

STRUCTURE
The net is 1 m wide (+/- 3 cm) and 9.50 to 10 metres long (with 25 to 50 cm on each
side of the side bands), made of 10 cm square black mesh (Diagram 3).
At its top, a horizontal band, 7 cm wide, made of two-fold white canvas is sewn along
its full length. Each extreme end of the band has a hole, through which passes a cord
fastening the band to the posts for keeping its top taut.
Within the band a flexible cable fastens the net to the posts and keeps its top taut.
At the bottom of the net, there is another horizontal band, 5 cm wide, similar to the top
band, through which is threaded a rope. This rope fastens the net to the posts and
keeps its lower part taut.

2.3

SIDE-BANDS
Two white bands are fastened vertically to the net and placed directly above each
sideline. They are 5 cm wide and 1 m long and are considered as part of the net.

2.4

ANTENNAE
An antenna is a flexible rod, 1.80 m long and 10 mm in diameter, made of fiberglass or
similar material.
An antenna is fastened at the outer edge of each side band. The antennae are placed
on opposite sides of the net (Diagram 3).
The top 80 cm of each antenna extends above the net and is marked with 10 cm
stripes of contrasting colour, preferably red and white.
The antennae are considered as part of the net and laterally delimit the crossing space
(Diagram 3, 5a, 5b, Rule 10.1.1).

2.5
2.5.1

POSTS
The posts supporting the net are placed at a distance of 0.50 - 1.00 m outside the side
lines (Diagram 3). They are 2.55 m high and preferably adjustable.

7.

STRUCTURE OF PLAY

7.1

THE TOSS

OR

7.1.2.2

the side of the court.

7.2

OFFICIAL WARM-UP SESSION

7.2.1

Prior to the match, if the teams have previously had a playing court exclusively at their
disposal, they are entitled to a 6-minute official warm-up period together at the net; if
not, they may have 10 minutes.

7.2.2

If either captain requests separate (consecutive) official warm-ups at the net, the teams
are allowed 3 minutes each or 5 minutes each, according to Rule 7.2.1.

7.2.3

In the case of consecutive official warm-ups, the team that has the first service takes
the first turn at the net.
Volleyball Canada – All players must wear playing uniforms for the complete Protocol
and warm-up.

7.2.4

Volleyball Canada – In an effort to reduce the incidence of injuries and concussions
during warm-up, Volleyball Canada has developed the following warm-up protocol. This
protocol is to be followed by all teams during the designated on-court warm-up time:
a.

Athletes must remain on their side of the net immediately following an attack and
only move to the opposite side of the net from outside of the court. Athletes are
not permitted into the receiving court.

b.

Any ball from the receiving side of the court, entered to the attacking side, must
be entered from outside of the court.

c.

Retrieved balls must be returned along the sidelines of the court and not through
the receiving court.

d.

If the team is using both sides of the court, i.e. full court game type activity – only
one ball can be in play at any given time.

e.

Opposing teams are not permitted to use volleyballs in the free zone during the
other team’s allocated court time. It is recommended for the opposing team to
support the retrieval of volleyballs for the team on the court.

For teams that do not follow the warm-up protocol, the referees will note on the score
sheet the non-compliance of the warm-up protocol. The league, PTA, or Volleyball
Canada will determine the appropriate sanction.
7.3

TEAM STARTING LINE-UP

7.3.1

There must always be six players per team in play.
The team’s starting line-up indicates the rotational order of the players on the court.
This order must be maintained throughout the set.

-24-

7.3.2

Before the start of each set, the coach has to present the starting line-up of his/her
team on a line-up sheet or via the electronic device, if used. The sheet is submitted,
duly filled in and signed, to the second referee or the scorer – or electronically sent
directly to the e-scorer.

7.3.3

The players who are not in the starting line-up of a set are the substitutes for that set
(except the Liberos). (Rules 7.3.2, 15.5)

7.3.4

Once the line-up sheet has been delivered to the second referee or scorer, no change
in line-up may be authorized without a regular substitution.

7.3.5

Discrepancies between players’ position on court and on the line-up sheet are dealt
with as follows:
7.3.5.1

When such a discrepancy is discovered before the start of the set, players’
positions must be rectified according to those on the line-up sheet. There will
be no sanction.

7.3.5.2

When, before the start of the set, a player on court is found not to be
registered on the line-up sheet of that set, this player must be changed to
conform to the line-up sheet. There will be no sanction.

7.3.5.3

However, if the coach wishes to keep such non-recorded player(s) on the
court, he/she has to request regular substitution(s), by use of the
corresponding hand signal, which will then be recorded on the score sheet.
If a discrepancy between players’ positions and the line-up sheet is
discovered later, the team at fault must revert to the correct positions. The
opponent’s points remain valid and in addition they receive a point and the
next service. All points scored by the team at fault from the exact moment of
the fault up to the discovery of the fault are cancelled.

7.3.5.4

Where a player is found to be on court, but he/she is not registered on the
team roster, the opponent’s points remain valid, and in addition they gain a
point and service. The team at fault will lose all points and/or sets (0:25, if
necessary) gained from the moment the non-registered player entered the
court, and will have to submit a revised line-up sheet and send a new
registered player into the court, in the position of the non-registered player.

7.4

POSITIONS
At the moment the ball is hit by the server, each team must be positioned within its own
court in the rotational order (except the server).

7.4.1

The positions of the players are numbered as follows:
7.4.1.1

The three players along the net are front-row players and occupy positions 4
(front-left), 3 (front-centre) and 2 (front-right).
-25-

7.4.1.2

The other three are back-row players occupying positions 5 (back-left), 6
(back-centre) and 1 (back-right).

7.4.2

Relative positions between players:’
7.4.2.1

Each back-row player must be positioned further back from the centre line
than the corresponding front-row player.

7.4.2.2

The front-row players and the back-row players, respectively, must be
positioned laterally in the order indicated in Rule 7.4.1.

7.4.3

The positions of players are determined and controlled according to the positions of
their feet contacting the ground (the last contact with the floor fixes the player’s
position), as follows (Diagram 4):
7.4.3.1

each back-row player must be level with or have at least a part of one foot
further from the centre line than the front foot of the corresponding front-row
player.

7.4.3.2

each right (left) side player must be level with or have at least a part of one
foot closer to the right (left) side line than the feet further from the right (left)
side line of the other players in that row.

7.4.4

After the service hit, the players may move around and occupy any position on their
court and the free zone.

7.5

POSITIONAL FAULT

7.5.1

The team commits a positional fault, if any player is not in his/her correct position at the
moment the ball is hit by the server (Rules 7.3 & 7.4). When a player is on court
through illegal substitution, and play restarts, this is counted as a positional fault with
the consequences of an illegal substitution.

7.5.2

If the server commits a serving fault at the moment of the service hit, (Rules 12.4 &
12.7.1), the server’s fault is counted before a positional fault.

7.5.3

If the service becomes faulty after the service hit, (Rule 12.7.2), it is the positional fault
that will be counted.

7.5.4

A positional fault leads to the following consequences:
7.5.4.1

the team is sanctioned with a point and service to the opponent

7.5.4.2

players’ positions must be rectified.

7.6

ROTATION

7.6.1

The rotational order is determined by the team’s starting line-up and controlled with the
service order and players’ positions throughout the set.

-26-

7.6.2

When the receiving team has gained the right to serve, its players rotate one position
clockwise: the player in position 2 rotates to position 1 to serve, the player in position 1
rotates to position 6, etc.

7.7

ROTATIONAL FAULT

7.7.1

A rotational fault is committed when the SERVICE is not made according to the
rotational order (Rule 7.6.1). It leads to the following consequences in order:
7.7.1.1

the scorer stops play by the buzzer; the opponent gains a point and next
service.
If the rotational fault is determined only after the completion of the rally which
started with a rotational fault, only a single point is awarded to the opponent,
regardless of the result of the rally played.

7.7.1.2
7.7.2

the rotational order of the faulty team must be rectified

Additionally, the scorer should determine the exact moment when the fault was
committed, and all points scored subsequently by the team at fault must be cancelled.
The opponent’s points remain valid.
If that moment cannot be determined, no point(s) cancellation takes place, and a point
and service to the opponent is the only sanction.

considered in the action of playing the ball, even if no contact is made with it.
However, touching the net outside the antenna is not to be considered a fault (except
for Rule 9.1.3).

12.

SERVICE
The service is the act of putting the ball into play, by the back-right player, placed in the
service zone (Rule 12.4.1).

12.1

FIRST SERVICE IN A SET

12.1.1

The first service of the first set, as well as that of the deciding set (3rd or 5th) is executed
by the team determined by the toss (Rule 7.1).

12.1.2

The other sets will be started with the service of the team that did not serve first in the
previous set.

12.2

SERVICE ORDER

12.2.1

The players must follow the service order recorded on the line-up sheet (Rule 7.3.1 &
7.3.2).

-31-

After the first service in a set, the player to serve is determined as follows:
12.2.2.1 When the serving team wins the rally, the player (or his/her substitute) who
served before, serves again.
12.2.2.2 When the receiving team wins the rally, it gains the right to serve and rotates
before actually serving. The player who moves from the front right position to
the back-right position will serve. (Rule 6,1,3 & 7.6.2)

12.3

AUTHORIZATION OF THE SERVICE
The first referee authorizes the service, after having checked that the two teams are
ready to play and that the server is in possession of the ball.

12.4

EXECUTION OF THE SERVICE

12.4.1

The ball shall be hit with one hand or any part of the arm after being tossed or released
from the hand(s).

Only one toss or release of the ball is allowed. Dribbling or moving the ball in the hands
is permitted.

12.4.3

At the moment of the service hit or take-off for a jump service, the server must not
touch the court (the end line included) or the floor outside the service zone.
After the hit, he/she may step or land outside the service zone, or inside the court.

collective screening, from seeing the service hit and the flight path of the ball.

12.5.2

A player or a group of players of the serving team make(s) a screen by waving arms,
jumping or moving sideways during the execution of the service, or by standing
grouped, in order that both the service hit and the flight path of the ball are hidden until
the ball reaches the vertical plane of the net. Should either be visible to the receiving
team this is not a screen.

12.5.3

Any player of the serving team is forbidden to raise hands above the head during
service, until the ball has passed beyond the net.
The first referee is permitted to caution (advise) a team through the game captain, if
he/she suspects that it is deliberately screening.

12.6

FAULTS MADE DURING THE SERVICE

12.6.1

Serving faults:
The following faults lead to a change of service even if the opponent is out of position
(Rule 12.7.1). The server:

-32-

12.6.1.1 violates the service order (Rule 12.2);
12.6.1.2 does not execute the service properly (Rule 12.4).
12.6.2

Faults after the service hit:
After the ball has been correctly hit, the service becomes a fault (unless a player is out
of position) if the ball (Rule 12.4 & 12.7.2):
12.6.2.1 touches a player of the serving team or fails to cross the vertical plane of the
net completely through the crossing space (Rules 8.4.4, 8.4.5, 10.1.1);
(

12.6.2.2 goes “out” (Rule 8.4);
12.6.2.3 passes over a screen (Rule 12.5).
12.7

SERVING FAULTS AND POSITIONAL FAULTS

12.7.1

If the server makes a fault at the moment of the service hit (improper execution, wrong
rotational order, etc.) and the opponent is out of position, it is the serving fault which is
sanctioned.

12.7.2

Instead, if the execution of the service has been correct, but the service subsequently
becomes faulty (goes out, goes over a screen, etc.), the positional fault has taken
place first and is sanctioned.

13.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ATTACK HIT

13.1.1

All actions which direct the ball towards the opponents, with the exception of service

coach does not need to make a substitution hand signal except if the substitution is for
injury or before the start of the set.
Volleyball Canada - if there is no buzzer, the referee will use his/her whistle to
announce and authorize the request for a substitution.

VOLLEYBALL CANADA — WIPING OF THE FLOOR
Referees must allow time for the wiping of the floor should it become too wet or
slippery to play on. Towels should be placed on either side of the court. Once a proper
request has been made and acknowledged by the officials, the players may take and
use freely, either towel, to wipe the floor. Players may also carry their own “small” towel
for this purpose. In such cases where wiping of the floor is considered unnecessary
after a request has been made or should the action of wiping be deliberately delayed, a
delay of game sanction may be imposed. Should quick moppers be available, they will
perform the above tasks under the supervision of the referees.

Chapter Six
THE LIBERO PLAYER
19.

THE LIBERO PLAYER

19.1

DESIGNATION OF THE LIBERO

19.1.1

Each team has the right to designate from the list of players on the score sheet up to
two specialist defensive players: Liberos
Volleyball Canada
Teams competing the 14U and 15U age classifications are not permitted to use a
Libero in competition
Teams competing in the 16U, 17U and 18U age classifications are permitted to use
only one (1) Libero per set
•

The Libero may be re-designated after each set

•

The number of the Libero must be on the line-up sheet for each set

•

If the coach decides to re-designate the Libero between sets, the new Libero
may be any player registered on the scoresheet

•

The number of the uniform for the re-designated Libero must be the same as
that player’s number recorded on the scoresheet

•

The replaced Libero can now act as a regular player, providing he/she has
the correct uniform

19.1.2

All Liberos must be recorded on the score sheet in the special lines reserved for this.
Volleyball Canada - The Libero is to be recorded on the score sheet with the team
roster, not on the special line. The number of the Libero is to be recorded on the lineup sheet for all sets.

19.1.3

The Libero on court is the Acting Libero. If there is another Libero, he/she is the
second Libero for the team.
Only one Libero may be on court at any time.

19.2

EQUIPMENT
The Libero player(s) must wear a uniform (or jacket/bib for the re-designated Libero)
which has a different dominant colour from any colour of the rest of the team. The
uniform must clearly contrast with the rest of the team. Both Liberos can be in
uniforms different from each other and from the rest of the team.
-41-

The Libero uniforms must be numbered like the rest of the team.

19.3.1.2 He/she is restricted to perform as a back-row player and is not allowed to
complete an attack hit from anywhere (including playing court and free zone)
if at the moment of the contact, the ball is entirely higher than the top of the
net.
19.3.1.3 He/she may not serve, block, or attempt to block.
19.3.1.4 A player may not complete an attack hit when the ball is entirely higher than
the top of the net, if the ball is coming from an overhand finger pass by a
Libero in his/her front zone. The ball may be freely attacked if the Libero
makes the same action from outside his/her front zone.

19.3.2

Libero Replacements
19.3.2.1 Libero Replacements are not counted as substitutions.
They are unlimited but there must be a completed rally between two Libero
replacements (unless a penalty causes the team to rotate and the Libero to
move to position four, or the Acting Libero becomes unable to play, making
the rally incomplete). (Also See Rules 15.5, 6.1.3)
19.3.2.2 The regular replacement player may replace and be replaced by either
Libero. The Acting Libero can only be replaced by the regular replacement
player for that position or by the second Libero.
19.3.2.3 At the start of each set, the Libero cannot enter the court until the second
referee has checked the line-up and authorised a Libero replacement with a
starting player.
19.3.2.4 Other Libero replacements must only take place while the ball is out of play
and before the whistle for service.
19.3.2.5 A Libero replacement made after the whistle for service but before the
service hit should not be rejected; however, at the end of the rally, the game
captain must be informed that this is not a permitted procedure, and that
repetition will be subject to delay sanctions.
19.3.2.6 Subsequent late Libero replacements shall result in the play being
interrupted immediately and the imposition of a delay sanction. The team to
serve next will be determined by the level of the delay sanction.

-42-

19.3.2.7 The Libero and the replacing player may only enter or leave the court
through the "Libero Replacement Zone" (Also see Rules 1.4.4, D.1b).
19.3.2.8 Libero replacements must be recorded in the Libero Control Sheet (if one is
used) or on the electronic score sheet.
19.3.2.9 An illegal Libero replacement can involve (amongst others):
- No completed rally between Libero replacements
- The Libero being replaced by a player other than the second Libero or the
regular replacement player.
- An illegal Libero replacement should be considered in the same way as an
illegal substitution:
- should the illegal Libero replacement be noticed before the start of the next
rally, then this is corrected by the referees, and the team is sanctioned for
delay;
- should the illegal Libero replacement be noticed after the service hit, the
consequences are the same as for an illegal substitution.
19.4

RE-DESIGNATION OF A NEW LIBERO

19.4.1

The Libero becomes unable to play if injured, ill, expelled or disqualified.
The Libero can be declared unable to play for any reason by the coach or, in the

to play, the coach (or game captain if no coach is present) may re-designate
as Libero for the remainder of the match any other player (replacement
player excepted) not on the court at the moment of the re-designation.
19.4.2.2 If the Acting Libero becomes unable to play, he/she may be replaced by the
regular replacement player or immediately and directly to court by a redesignated Libero. However, a Libero who is the subject of a re-designation
may not play for the remainder of the match.
If the Libero is not on court when declared unable to play, he/she may also
be the subject of a re-designation. The Libero declared unable to play may
not play for the remainder of the match.
19.4.2.3 The coach, or game captain if no coach is present, contacts the second
referee informing him/her about the re-designation.
19.4.2.4 Should a re-designated Libero become or be declared unable to play, further
re-designations are permitted.

19.4.2.5 If the coach requests the team captain to be re-designated as the new
Libero, this will be permitted.
19.4.2.6 In the case of a re-designated Libero, the number of the player redesignated as Libero
must be recorded on the score sheet remarks section and on the Libero control sheet (or
electronic score sheet if one is used).
19.4.3

Team with two Liberos
Where a team has registered on the score sheet two Liberos, but one becomes unable to
play the team has the right to play with only one Libero.

MISCONDUCT AND ITS SANCTIONS

21.1

prevent the teams from approaching the sanctioning level.
This is done in two stages:
Stage 1: by issuing a verbal warning through the game captain;
-44-

Stage 2: by use of a YELLOW CARD to the team member(s) concerned.
This formal warning is not in itself a sanction but a symbol that the team member (and
by extension the team) has reached the sanctioning level for the match. It is recorded
on the score sheet but has no immediate consequences.
21.2

MISCONDUCT LEADING TO SANCTIONS
Incorrect conduct by a team member towards officials, opponents, team-mates or
spectators is classified in three categories according to the seriousness of the offence.

21.2.1

Rude Conduct: action contrary to good manners or moral principles.

21.2.2

Offensive Conduct: defamatory or insulting words or gestures or any action
expressing contempt.

21.2.3

Aggression: actual physical attack or aggressive or threatening behaviour.

21.3

SANCTION SCALE
According to the judgment of the first referee and depending on the seriousness of the
offence, the sanctions to be applied and recorded on the score sheet are: Penalty,
Expulsion or Disqualification.

21.3.1

Penalty
The first rude conduct in the match by any team member is penalized with a point and
service to the opponent.

21.3.3.3 A second offensive conduct in the same match by the same team member is
sanctioned by disqualification with no other consequences.
21.3.3.4 The third rude conduct in the same match by the same team member is
sanctioned by disqualification with no other consequences.
Volleyball Canada – in the absence of a team dressing room, an expelled or
disqualified participant must leave the Competition Control Area which
includes any viewing spaces (spectator seating, viewing boxes, or any area
overseeing the playing area).
The disqualified participant is not allowed to return to the Competition Area
following the conclusion of the match.

21.4

APPLICATION OF MISCONDUCT SANCTIONS

21.4.1

All misconduct sanctions are individual sanctions, remain in force for the entire match
and are recorded on the score sheet.

21.4.2

The repetition of misconduct by the same team member in the same match is
sanctioned progressively (the team member receives a heavier sanction for each
successive offence).

21.4.3

Expulsion or disqualification due to offensive conduct or aggression does not require a
previous sanction.

21.5

MISCONDUCT BEFORE AND BETWEEN SETS
Any misconduct occurring before or between sets is sanctioned according to Rule 21.3
and sanctions apply in the following set.

21.6

SUMMARY OF MISCONDUCT AND CARDS USED

Additional Details for Youth Recreational Rules of the Game
6 – 8 Volleyball
This age category and LTD stage, Fundamentals, has no formal competitions. Volleyball
programs can use Level 2 Smashball Rules of the game as a vehicle to have fun, develop skills,
teach game concepts, and develop physical literacy.
For more details ono Smashball, download the Smashball Trainer App.
8 – 12 Volleyball
The following recommendations are for schools, clubs or Provincial/Territorial Associations
running an 8 – 12 year old jamboree/festival style event or recreational tournament within a
local/regional area.
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

•

•
•

10-minute timed games with a 3 – 5 minute transition period
Be creative to indicate the end of a game, including music, time clock, or fun instructor
statement
Try to establish evenly skilled teams of 3. If uneven numbers, a 4th player can rotate
into the game
Have players create a team name
Use a round robin or ladder style draw to help keep opponents evenly balanced.
Net height should be based on the reach of the shortest player (wrist), however for
safety reasons, the net height must not be lower than the top of the tallest player’s
head
Any player on any team may choose to catch & toss the first contact, or catch, self-toss
& set the second contact
If there are limited rallies, coaches can ask ‘Why do you think there are no rallies?’ or
‘If we used a catch & toss for the first or second contact, would this be more fun?’
After probing questions, coaches can leave it to the kids to decide how they want to
play the ball
Referee should not be used. Play is managed by the athletes. A knowledgeable lead
should be available to support greater understanding of the concepts of the game and
ensure all participants are having fun without dispute over rule interpretations
Keeping score is not necessary. However, informal scores/skill level from games can
be noted by the lead organizer to ensure teams are of even skill levels
Coaching tips to support understanding the rules of the game:
o
Goal of the game: Make the ball bounce twice on the other side
o
Once the ball is in, it is always in (Ex: if the ball bounces in the court and
goes beyond the boundary lines)
o
The lines and the players are all considered inside the court

12 – 14 Volleyball
4 v 4 Volleyball:
•
It is recommended there be no more than five (5) players per team and players rotate
into the game after the serve
•
Referees should not be used. Players and coaches manage the match, including:
o
Using flip charts to track the score (if desired), but no scoresheets
o
If there is an injury or a ‘no show’, teams may play 3 v 4
o
Matches consist of two 12-minute timed sets
6 v 6 Volleyball:
•
Fair Play rules apply
•
All players listed on the scoresheet must start the first or second set
•
Substitutions are not permitted in the first or second set:
o
In the case of injury, an Exceptional Substitution may be made
o
The injured/ill player may not return to the same set but may return to play in
subsequent sets
o
If a player is expelled or disqualified, there must be a legal substitution for
the set to continue.
•
Any line-up can be used at the start of the third set
-48-

6 v 6 Tripleball:
•
Request for substitution can only occur between a three-ball sequence
•
In the deciding set, teams switch sides once a team reaches 8 points. If this occurs
during a three-ball sequence, then the change of court will be made after the sequence
is complete
Tripleball Sequence
The goal of Tripleball is to promote better skill development through more rallies, increase
participation, and encourage meaningful competition and fun.
Overview of the Tripleball Sequence:
a) The game follows a sequence of three rallies (service, tossed ball 1, tossed ball 2).
- 1st rally – introduced by the server
- 2nd rally – tossed ball given to the receiving team
- 3rd rally – tossed ball given to the serving team
b) The service rotates between teams after each three-ball sequence.
c) A team must rotate and introduce a new server when it is their turn to serve.
d) Every ball introduced is worth one point.

Note:
a)
Time-outs cannot occur during a 3-ball sequence. These requests must be made before
the introduction of serve.
Guidelines for Tossers:
a)
The Head Coach, Assistant Coach or a volunteer may be the “Tosser” and introduce balls
to their own team.
b)
Balls are tossed underhand with two hands, with little to no spin and above the height of
the antennae to allow athletes time to play the ball.
c)
The Tosser can step into the court to introduce the ball but must immediately move a safe
distance away from the court after the toss.
d)
The free ball must be tossed directly to the athlete in the centre back position (rotationally
in position 6), otherwise a replay will occur.
e)
The free ball will be introduced when the front row players are at the net and ready to
transition; the Tosser verbally cues the athletes by calling “Free Ball”.
f)
Tossers must encourage a fast-paced transition between an end of a rally and the next
toss.
Ball Retrievers:
a)
It is recommended to have volunteers or athletes who are not involved in the set, to be
designated as Ball Retrievers. At the completion of each rally, athletes should be
encouraged to quickly roll balls to the Ball Retrievers to speed up the pace of the game.

line(s);
29.2.1.2 the touches of “out” balls by the team receiving the ball;
29.2.1.3 the ball touching the antenna, the served ball and the third hit of the team

VOLLEYBALL CANADA BLOOD POLICY FOR COMPETITION

31.1

BLEEDING
If an athlete is bleeding and other participants are at risk of exposure to his/her blood,
the athlete's participation in the match must be interrupted until the bleeding has
stopped, and the wound has been cleaned with an antiseptic solution and securely
covered. A one-minute technical time-out would be applied by the referee in order to
rectify the situation and stop the bleeding before a legal substitution, exceptional
substitution, or injury time-out would become necessary. The players are to remain on
the court while the situation is being rectified. The technical time-out is not charged to
either team. The technical time-out may occur only once for the same player in the
match and is recorded on the scoresheet under remarks.

31.1.1

Legal Substitution
If possible, a legal substitution would be used. The bleeding player may return to the
set once the bleeding has stopped, and the wound has been cleaned and covered
providing the return is legal. (Rule 15.6)

31.1.2

Exceptional Substitution
If a legal substitution is not possible then the referee would authorize an exceptional
substitution. The blood-injury player cannot return for the remainder of that set. The
blood-injury player may play in subsequent sets providing the bleeding has stopped
and the wound has been cleaned and covered. (Rule 15.7)
Recovery Time
If a blood-injury injured player cannot be substituted, legally or exceptionally, this
player is given a three-minute recovery time in order to stop the bleeding and to cover
the affected area. This may occur only once for the same player in the match. If the
bleeding cannot be stopped, his/her team is declared incomplete. (Rule 17.1)

31.2

TEAM UNIFORMS
All team uniforms soiled with blood must be either replaced or cleaned prior to the
blood-injury athlete resuming the competition. Uniforms are to be cleaned until the
stain is completely removed.

-60-

31.2.1

Domestic Competition
If a replacement uniform is not available, a player with a jersey soiled with blood would
be allowed to wear a different numbered jersey or to change jerseys with a player on
the bench. The referee would change the number(s) of the player(s) involved on the
scoresheet. The procedure to be used would be Rule 15.6, Rule 15.7, Rule 17.1, or a
time-out.
- The one-minute technical time-out applies.
- Record on the scoresheet under remarks.
NOTE: This rule also applies to the Libero player if the team has an additional Libero
uniform that can be used.

32.

VOLLEYBALL CANADA CONCUSSION POLICY FOR COMPETITION

32.1

CONCUSSION
In the situation where an athlete is struck in the head and the coach requests a
preliminary symptom check for concussion, a one-minute technical time out would be
applied by the referee to rectify the situation before a legal substitution, exceptional
substitution or recovery time would become necessary.
The players are to remain on the court while the situation is being rectified. The
technical time-out is not charged to either team. The technical time-out may occur only
once for the same player in the match and is recorded on the scoresheet under
remarks.
If it is determined that the athlete should be removed for a complete concussion
assessment, the athlete may not return to competition until the results of the
assessment are known.

32.1.1

Legal Substitution
If possible, a legal substitution would be used. The athlete undergoing concussion
assessment may return to the set if deemed clear to continue, providing the return is
legal. (Rule 15.6)

32.1.2

Exceptional Substitution
If a legal substitution is not possible then the referee would authorize an exceptional
substitution. The athlete undergoing concussion assessment cannot return to play for
the remainder of that set. The athlete undergoing concussion assessment may play in
subsequent sets providing the results of test deem them clear to continue. (Rule 15.7)

32.1.3

Recovery Time
if an athlete requiring concussion assessment cannot be substituted legally or
exceptionally, this player is given a three-minute recovery time. This may occur only
once for the same player in the match. If the player is not able to return at the end of
the recovery time, the team is declared incomplete. (Rule 17.1)

HOW TO CHECK THE DIMENSIONS OF THE COURT

-84-

DEFINITIONS
Competition Control Area: The Competition Control Area is a corridor around the playing court
and free zone, which includes all spaces up to the outer barriers or delimitation fence. (see
diagram / fig 1a).
Zones: These are sections within the playing area (i.e. playing court and free zone) as defined
for a specific purpose (or with special restrictions) within the rule text. These include Front Zone,
Service Zone, Substitution Zone, Free Zone, Back Zone, and Libero Replacement Zone.
Areas: These are sections of the floor OUTSIDE the free zone, identified by the rules as having
a specific function. These include Warm up Area and Penalty Area.
Lower Space: This is the space defined at its upper part by the bottom of the net and the cord
joining it to the posts, at the sides by the posts, and at the bottom by the playing surface.
Crossing Space: The crossing space is defined by: - the horizontal band at the top of the net; the antennae and their extension; - the ceiling. The ball must cross to the opponent’s COURT
through the crossing space.
External Space: The external space is in the vertical plane of the net outside of the crossing and
lower spaces.
Substitution Zone: This is the part of the free zone through which substitutions are carried out.
Unless by agreement of FIVB: This statement recognizes that while there are regulations on
the standards and specification of equipment and facilities, there are occasions when special
arrangements can be made by FIVB in order to promote the game of volleyball or to test new
conditions.
FIVB Standards: The technical specifications or limits as defined by FIVB to the manufacturers
of equipment.
Fault: (i) A playing action contrary to the rules. (ii) A rule violation other than a playing action.
Dribbling: Dribbling means bouncing the ball (usually as a preparation to tossing and serving).
Other preparatory actions could include (amongst others) moving the ball from hand to hand.
Technical Time Out: This special mandatory time out is, in addition to time outs, to allow the
promotion of volleyball by analysis of the play and to allow additional commercial opportunities.
Technical Time Outs are mandatory for FIVB World and Official competitions.
Ball Retrievers: These are personnel whose job it is to maintain the flow of the game by rolling
the ball to the server between rallies.

-85-

Quick Moppers: are personnel whos’ job it is to keep the floor clean and dry, if necessary, after
each rally using small towels.
First Hit of the Team: There are four cases when the playing action is considered the first hit of
the team:
-

Service Reception

-

Receiving an attack of the opponent team

-

Playing the ball rebounding from own block

-

Playing the ball rebounding from opponent’s block

Rally Point: This is the system of scoring a point whenever a rally is won.
Interval: The time between sets. The change of courts in the fifth (deciding) set is not to be
regarded as an interval.
Re-designation: This is the act by which a Libero, who cannot continue or is declared by the
team “unable to play”, has his/her role taken by any other player (except the regular replacement
player) not on the court at the moment of the re-designation.
Replacement: This is the act by which a regular player leaves the court and either Libero (if
more than one) takes his/her place. This can even include Libero for Libero exchanges. The
regular player can then replace either Libero. There must be a completed rally between
replacements involving any Libero.
Interfering: Any action which will create an advantage against the opponent team or any action
which prevents an opponent from playing the ball.
Outside Object: An object or a person which while outside the playing court or close to the limit
of the free playing space provides an obstruction to the flight of the ball. For example: overhead
lights, the referee’s chair, TV equipment, scorer’s table, and net posts. Outside objects do not
include the antennae since they are considered as the part of the net.
Substitution: This is the act by which one regular player leaves the court and another regular
player takes his/her place.
Protocol: The series of events before the start of the match including the toss, the warming-up
session, presentation of the teams and referees as described in the specific Competition
Handbook.

6. The referees and line judges take up their positions.
7. The first referee requests the teams (the six starting players) to line up on the baseline.

enter the court and take up their positions. This applies to set one only. For all other
sets, the teams will go directly onto the playing court.
8. The second referee will check the rotational order of both teams.
9. The second referee will hand the ball to the first server. If the three-ball system is used,
the second referee will give two balls to the ball retrievers and then give a ball to the
first server. Using the three-ball system, the second referee will only give the ball to the
first server in set one and the deciding set.
10. The second referee will indicate to the first referee that he/she and the scorer are
ready to start the match.
11. The first referee will authorize the first service (whistle and signal).

second referee blows his whistle to direct the teams on to the court. For set one the
teams line up on the baseline. For all other sets, the players go directly on to the court.
The second referee will then check that the six players for each team are the same as
those registered on the line-up sheet. The second referee will also check that the
number of the Libero (if used by the team) is recorded on the line-up sheet. After
checking the team line-up, the second referee will authorize the Libero to enter the
court.
When using the three-ball system, the ball retriever will then give the server the ball.

The following may be duplicated for all VC sanctioned and/or National Championship
tournaments.
1.

This tournament is sanctioned by Volleyball Canada.

2.

All participants must be registered with Volleyball Canada and be able to show proof of
registration.

3.

Playing rules of the tournament will be those of the current year's Volleyball Canada
rulebook.

4.

TIE-BREAKING PROCEDURES
Two (2) teams tied: When two teams are tied, the winner of the head-to-head match during
the round will be ranked higher.
Three (3) teams or more: When three or more teams are tied, the tie-breaking criteria are
applied one after the other until all of the tied teams have been ranked:
a) the team having the best ratio of won/lost matches, considering all matches played during
the round between the tied teams, will be ranked higher;
b) The team having the best ratio of won/lost sets, considering all matches played during
the round between the tied teams, will be ranked higher;
c) The team having the best ratio of won/lost sets, considering all matches d u r i n g the
round, will be ranked higher;
d) The team having the best ratio of points for/against, considering sets played between the
tied teams during the round, will be ranked higher;
e) The team having the best ratio of points for/against, considering all sets played during
the round, will be ranked higher;
f)

As determined by the Organizing Committee (e.g. extra set, toss of coin, etc.)

NOTE: This means that if there is a tie among teams X, Y and Z and criteria “b” is able to
determine X as first, Y as second and Z as third, then no further criteria are to be used. The
tie is broken.
However, if criteria ‘b’ determines the seeding/ranking of any of the tied teams, then the
remaining teams which are still tied will use criteria ‘c’ and so on to determine their
seeding/ranking. Do not start at ‘a’ again. Continue through the sequence of criteria using
the results of teams x, y, and z for criteria ‘d’.

-95-

5.

FORFEIT
All matches shall start on time as scheduled. Failure of a team to be ready to play at the
scheduled game time will be penalized by the loss of the first set by forfeit. A further 15
minutes will be allowed before forfeiture of the second set. Forfeiture of the third set (if
necessary) will occur after an additional 15 minutes. It is expected that every effort will be
made to reschedule a match which might be forfeited because of unusual circumstances (i.e.
transportation breakdown, etc.). In the event of a delay caused by a long previous match,
teams will be allowed 10 minutes on the court for warming up.

6.

The rule on uniforms will be strictly enforced. All team members must have identical
playing shirts and shorts in good condition and according to the regulations.
Comment: Refer to Referees Guidelines or the Team Registration booklet for the
procedure to be followed at Volleyball Canada National Championships.

7.

VC's approved ball will be the official tournament ball and will be supplied by the
Organizing Committee.

8.

Air-horns operated with CO2 cartridges or any other mechanical means are prohibited to
be used at all Volleyball Canada events.

9.

Any protest must be submitted to the Jury (protest committee - e.g. Tournament
Committee, Referee Supervisor, Volleyball Canada Representative) by the referees
immediately and its decision will be final.

10.

Any additional tournament regulations as deemed necessary by the tournament Organizing
Committee will be distributed to the teams on the site.

-96-

PROTEST PROCEDURES
Most tournaments are organized to allow the settling of a protest immediately, and the procedure
is usually outlined in the tournament rules.
If the protest occurs during league play, or any other time a protest committee is not on the site,
the referee must know how to handle the situation.
THE REFEREE’S DECISIONS REGARDING BALL HANDLING FAULTS ARE NOT OPEN TO
PROTEST.
A captain may legally protest only AN ERROR IN APPLYING A RULE OR RULE
INTERPRETATION. The captain must lodge the protest immediately to the first referee who will
then indicate to the scorekeeper that a protest has been lodged. Once the match has ended, the
captain must describe the incident on the scoresheet or on a paper to be attached to the
scoresheet before he signs off the scoresheet. This record includes game number, score, ball
possession and player position on floor at time of protested decision, and reason for protest. The
protest is then referred to the appropriate higher authority (i.e. league executive, jury) for
acceptance or refusal. Refusal means that the game or match result stands as played.
Acceptance involves replaying of the event in whole or in part depending on the judgment and in
the next available gym space as allocated by the DCC Jury member.

JUDGES’ CONFERENCE
At Canadian Championships, the procedure for a judges’ conference can be used to rule on
protests.
The judges’ conference holds official authority to solve problems occurring during the game in
order to correct an improper situation in accordance with Volleyball Canada rules and
regulations.
Only the following circumstances are protestable:
a) an improper decision by the referee who did not apply the rules or regulations;
b) an improper decision of the scorer who made a mistake on the rotational order or on the
score.
A referee’s decision regarding a playing action (i.e. ball handling or a misconduct) cannot be
protested.
The protest will be accepted or rejected prior to the resumption of play by the tournament jury.

-97-

DISCIPLINARY ACTION
Violations of VC's Code of Conduct/Protest and/or competition rules and regulations may subject
the offending player(s), coach(es), official(s), manager(s), administrator(s) or team(s) to
disciplinary action as outlined under "Penalties”.
PROCEDURES
All violations of the Code of Conduct/Protest which occur during or as a result of a VC National
Championship shall be reported immediately to the onsite National Indoor Committee (NIC)
representative by the tournament director and shall be confirmed in writing. All violations will be
investigated by the tournament jury.
NOTE:

Code of Conduct violations incurred at provincially sanctioned events and involving
persons from the jurisdiction in which the infraction took place should be handled in an
identical manner by the region. VC's Executive Committee would act solely in the role
of appeal.

All VC National Championships will be overseen by a jury which will be composed of:
a)

a member of the NIC or an approved designate who will act as chairperson of the jury;

b)

a representative of the National Championship Host Committee;

c)

a member of the National Referee Committee (NRC) or the Referee Supervisor.

The jury is the highest authority in all aspects of the competition. Its decisions take precedence
and cannot be appealed on site.
The jury makes the final decision regarding complaints about tournament organization, results,
technical matters, and breaches of the Code of Conduct, or any other related matter.
Any person having knowledge of, or making allegation in respect to, a violation of the Code of
Conduct during or as a result of a VC National Championships, shall report verbally and in
writing, the alleged violation to the Tournament Director and Site Coordinator or any member of
the jury.
Upon receipts of the reports, the NIC representative will convene the jury to investigate the
violation of the Code of Conduct.
a)

The tournament director or site coordinator shall determine the names and addresses of
the alleged violator(s);

b)

The tournament director or site coordinator shall determine the circumstances of the
alleged violation.

The NIC representative shall notify the alleged violator(s) that the jury will be convened
immediately

to conduct a hearing into the alleged violation and would take action accordingly.

.
-98-

The following steps will be taken:
a)

Notify both teams that there is a protest and hold both teams in the gym until the procedure
is established.

b)

Chairperson of jury convenes the jury.

c)

The jury will interview and secure a statement from any witnesses to the alleged violation.

d)

If the violation occurred during a match, interviews will be held with the officials who
conducted the match and with the coaches and captains of each team where necessary
and appropriate.

e)

The jury will also interview and secure a statement from the person(s) accused of the
violation.

f)

The jury would render a decision and possible penalty.

g)

The Chairperson of the jury would inform all parties concerned regarding the decision
made. A full written report on the incident and the jury's decision would be completed at
that time.

The NIC representative shall immediately transmit the written report to the NCC Chairperson who
shall confirm in writing the receipt of the written report.
The NIC Chair shall examine the report of the Jury committee and may conduct further
investigation as he/she deems necessary and prepare a record of the matter.
The NIC Chairperson shall forward to VC's National Office the report from the jury Committee
and any supplementary report containing the details and recommendations of his/her own
investigation.
HEARING
All persons accused of a Code of Conduct violation must be given an opportunity for a hearing in
the jurisdiction where the violation took place.
-

At a national championship, this hearing will be held on site with the NIC designate
conducting the hearing.

-

In VC sanctioned events, the chairperson of the jury conducts the hearing. If an immediate
hearing is not possible, the tournament director should collect all pertinent information and
forward it to the NIC Chairperson for action.

-99-

NOTIFICATION
Any person accused of a Code of Conduct violation must be notified in writing of the time, place
and date of the hearing. Such person is entitled to an alternate date if for a good cause the
original date is unacceptable. Should the accused person fail to attend the hearing, the person
conducting the hearing may proceed and take the evidence of those in attendance. The hearing
may accept or reject sworn statements provided by the witnesses.
RULINGS
After hearing all of the evidence, the person presiding at the hearing may take whatever action
he/she deems appropriate or may refer the matter to VC's President or Executive.
The accused person must then be advised in writing by VC's President and Chief Executive
Officer of the "Notice of Ruling" taken and any penalties imposed, if it hasn't already been
handled on site.
RIGHT OF APPEAL
Any person who has been penalized may appeal to VC's Board of Directors who shall determine
if a fair hearing was held and an equitable solution reached. The decision of the Board of
Directors shall be final. Any person desiring to appeal must notify the VC President and Chief
Executive Officer in writing outlining his/her intention. Such appeal must be received in Ottawa
within 60 days after mailing of the "Notice of Ruling" mentioned in "RULINGS" above. It is
understood that any such appeal will be reviewed by the Board of Directors at their next meeting.
PENALTIES
Penalties shall be at the discretion of the special commissioner or Executive Committee as
outlined below.
1)

Penalties imposed by VC may be in the form of a letter of censure, suspension, expulsion,
fines, or a combination of these, or any other penalty considered more suitable depending on
the offence.

2)

VC may impose penalties directly, notifying the regional association of the actions, or may
have the regional association impose a penalty.

3)

An active member being considered for penalization shall receive 30 days notice of same,
including reasons before any penalty is enacted.

-100-

CODE OF ETHICS
This code is not intended as a moralistic prescription of desirable behaviour that would restrict
the liberty of individual referees. Instead, it represents a list of positive recommendations based
on a plan of conduct accepted by officials as a whole.
It, therefore, consists of statements resembling rules of behaviour or maxims which those
involved with the rules of the game will find immediately acceptable and with which tacit
compliance is expected.
The philosophy of refereeing is based on the reason for having a body of rules that may in turn
be summed up in the following words:
“THE PURPOSE OF THE RULES IS TO ADMINISTER THE GAME AND PENALIZE A
PLAYER(S) WHO GAINS AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OVER HIS/HER OPPONENT AS THE
RESULT OF AN ILLEGAL ACTION.”
This realistic concept can serve as a basis for a uniform but intelligent application of the rules of
the game, derived from the following main principles.
FIRST PRINCIPLE
Coaches, instructors and players shall accept official interpretations of the rules governing their
sport as published by the Canadian Rules of the Game Commission.
SECOND PRINCIPLE
Officials are responsible for applying the rules of the game in accordance with the official
interpretations and shall comply with the refereeing code adopted by the national refereeing
commission.
THIRD PRINCIPLE
Officials shall intervene in respect to actions that have in fact occurred and have been observed
by them, and not on the basis of information received through third parties.
FOURTH PRINCIPLE
The fairness of the official’s decisions is based on an overall view of the situation and his/her
past experience of similar occurrences.
FIFTH PRINCIPLE
Except for situations in which a referee’s specific authority is stated in the rules of play or in the
refereeing code, all the officials shall make decisions on every punishable offence or fault
observed by them in competitive play.
SIXTH PRINCIPLE
Officials shall cooperate in developing discipline in the sport and in creating conditions for optimal
player performance, without misinterpreting the rules of play and in an impartial manner.

-101-

Since refereeing is to be regarded as an opportunity for self-development and not as a means of
working off individual frustrations, and since an individual acting as a referee should constantly
be striving to perform to the best of his/her abilities, officials will, therefore, see their role in light
of the spirit of the rules and will not attempt to use it to satisfy a craving for authority.
The official will be aware of and will accept that the only reason for his/her existence is to help
the players have a good match.
With a view to entrenching this notion, the Board of Referees and its members have adopted the
following principles.
A.
1.

IN RELATION TO THE PLAYER
The official shall ensure that the player has a reasonable opportunity to perform to the
best of his/her ability, within the limits of the rules.

2.

The official’s main concern shall be the player’s safety. Any situation affecting this prime
consideration of competition shall be avoided and/or terminated.

3.

During the game, the official is required to supervise; he/she must take all reasonable
steps to maintain a spirit of healthy competition. Accordingly:
a) He/she shall not permit intimidation of a player by other players or by team staff
either by word or action;
b) He/she shall not tolerate unacceptable conduct to officials, other players or
spectators;
c) He/she shall avoid pointless discussions with players in a match situation; only game
captains are authorized to address him/her.

4.

In the heat of play the official, in his/her relations with players and team staff, shall make
every effort to retain a presence of mind enabling him/her to direct the same with
complete objectivity and the dignity required by his/her position.

5.

When working in tournaments including novice players, the official shall accept the
educational role expected of him/her and shall adapt his/her conduct to this particular
aspect of the competition.

6.

Away from the immediate environment of play, the official shall be open to discussion
and contact with players, avoid any conduct suggesting self-importance, arrogance or
sarcasm, show himself/herself receptive to constructive criticism and demonstrate due
respect and consideration for different points of view and judgements.

7.

Outside the court, the official shall conduct himself/herself in such a way that his/her
relationship with players does not prejudice his/her subsequent work and the impartiality
that must be obvious in it.

-102-

B.

IN RELATION TO THE COACH

1.

The official’s conduct toward the coach and any other team staff shall be governed by
respect and courtesy.

2.

4.

Outside the match context, the official shall adopt an attitude conducive to positive
dialogue and calm communication with team staff. He/she will make a special effort to
listen to constructive criticism, having due regard to the uninhibited spirit of competition
prevailing in these circumstances, and shall demonstrate the necessary sense of proportion if subjected to the personal abuse that may result from such a situation.

C.

IN RELATION TO OTHER REFEREES

1.

Every official, in his/her relations with one or more other officials, shall consciously strive
to create and/or cooperate in creating a friendly or at least pleasant working atmosphere
governed by mutual respect, understanding, cordiality and, in particular, mutual

In performing their work, the members of a team of referees coming together to officiate
in a match shall strive to create this working atmosphere conducive to confidence,
cooperation and communication, with a view to optimal performance as a group.

3.

Every qualified minor or major official shall be accepted as a full member in a team of
referees assigned to a match; the first referee shall ensure that this principle is complied

team or referees in the action and shall thank them at the end of the match.

D.

IN RELATION TO HIS/HER WORK AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND HIS/HER
GENERAL CONDUCT

1.

The official shall make the necessary efforts to reach a high standard of competence,
encourage the atmosphere conducive to the conscientious performance of his/her duties
and contribute to preventing inadequate refereeing standards. The official shall
accordingly:
a) Not perform any refereeing duties under false pretenses concerning his/her skills and
qualifications, especially as regards the regularity of his/her registration with VC's
Board of Referees.
b) Not accept any present, benefit or favour that might subvert or appear to influence
his/her subsequent decisions or actions in the performance of his/her duties.

2.

Every referee shall perform his/her duties at acceptable physical and functional levels.
This includes the requirements that he/she:
a) Take the necessary action to maintain physical condition sufficient to meet the
organic and physical requirements of his/her duties;
b) Avoid performing duties if his/her faculties are significantly impaired by illness.
c) Rest sufficiently to be able to perform adequately.
d) Refrain from officiating while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

3.

When performing his/her duties, the official shall adopt an assured, dignified demeanor,

inherent in the rules and procedures.

REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING PERFORMANCE OF THE REFEREE’S DUTIES:
4.

Every official shall, while officiating, wear the uniform specified by Volleyball Canada and
shall present a clean, well-groomed appearance personally and in his/her dress.

5.

Each official shall seek to gradually acquire relevant experience and improve his/her
skills, without attempting to progress too fast, by studying the rules, confirming any
doubtful interpretation with the competent authority and by participating in training
courses available to him/her, in a spirit of continuous learning.

PARTICIPATION IN COMPETITIONS:
6.

The official must demonstrate complete reliability in relation to his/her commitments,
fulfill them without exception and faithfully keep formal oral promises to officiate.

-104-

7.

In accepting assignments to matches in a tournament, the official shall demonstrate
goodwill with a view to a division of work that is fair to all parties. The official will
therefore:
a) Be available throughout the tournament period.
b) Devote his/her full attention to each match in which he/she is involved.
c) Avoid making any conditions tending to limit his/her participation.

The above considerations apply to all situations not involving circumstances beyond the control
of the individual in question.
INVOLVEMENT IN A MATCH:
8.

An official’s first concern shall be to maintain the unshakable and absolute integrity of the
refereeing function, which should be especially evident in his/her most difficult decisions.
In accordance with this consideration, the official shall:
a) Not allow himself/herself to be advised or influenced by any player, team staff or
spectator;
b) In his/her actions be free of all partiality or prejudice toward either of the teams
involved;
c) Not make decisions with the intention of compensating for them in a decision
concerning a subsequent unrelated situation.

9.

The official shall demonstrate total commitment in the match situation and adopt an
appropriate attitude in his/her considered and discrete actions. He/she shall, for
example, AVOID:
a) Excessive fussiness in his/her judgements and stopping the game for insufficient
reason;
b) Dramatizing the seriousness of the events he/she is supervising.
c) Making himself/herself the centre of attention in the game, since his/her only reason
for being there is because of the players and to assist them.
d) Noting the smallest details of a situation with a view to punishment.
e) Allowing the game to continue without intervening when necessary, or pretending not
to see;
f)

10.

Taking the game lightly and not treating it seriously enough.

Through actions devoid of self-importance or arrogance, the official shall make a
conscious effort to supervise play in a calm manner and make decisions without
hesitation; this applies especially to difficult decisions, which he/she should announce
decisively, without being inhibited by the importance of the situation.

11.

The official should not, in an attempt to increase his/her standing or restore his/her
reputation with a third person, seek to justify himself/herself or apologize in relation to
difficult decisions made by him/her.

-105-

12.

At the end of a match, after checking and signing the score sheet, the official shall quietly
leave the court area without unnecessary delay.

13.

A referee shall, while officiating, refrain from any public statement concerning matches in
which he/she is involved, especially a prediction of the outcome of one of these matches.

1.

All officials who are members of the Board of Referees of VC shall be expected to act as
fitting representatives of volleyball and of VC.

representatives and fulfill his/her commitments in the agreed capacity as a referee,
clinician, official, in charge of a specific task or any other duty specified.

3.

Officials shall cooperate in developing volleyball and shall participate through their
practical and moral support, to the extent that their skills, interests and availability allow,
in building a solid and forward-looking organization.

and encourage their work.

HOW TO BECOME A REFEREE
Volleyball referees in Canada are governed by policies set forth by VC through the National
Referee Committee which in turn works in close co-operation with Regional Officials’ Chairpersons in each Region of the Association.
In order to become a “LOCAL” volleyball referee, an individual proceeds as follows:
a) Studies and learns the rules of the game;
b) Avails himself/herself to call practice games and matches between school, club or other
teams, in order to gain some practical experience;
c) Attends a referees' clinic sponsored by the Regional Association;
d) Submits to written and practical examinations set up by the Regional Officials’ Chairperson.
If successful, the referee is rated as a “LOCAL” Referee and should make himself/herself
available to officiate different types of volleyball matches as frequently as possible.
The next level of officiating is “PROVINCIAL”. This usually requires at least one year of
experience at the “LOCAL” level and a demonstrated advanced knowledge of the rules.
The next stage of qualification of an official is a “REGIONAL” Referee, which entails the
following:
a) Being active as a Provincial Referee for at least one full season;
b) Attending a Regional Referees' Clinic;
c) Written and practical examination for a Regional referee’s certificate;
d) Approval by National Officials’ Committee.
The next level is qualification as a “NATIONAL” Referee, which requires:
a) Being active as a Regional Referee for at least two years;
b) Recommendations of the Regional Officials’ Chairperson for upgrading, based on activity,
qualification and personal abilities;
c) Keeping the National Referee Committee advised of assignments at major tournaments as
specified;
d) Attending the National Theory Clinic by the VC Referees Committee;
e) Submitting to a written and practical examination administered by the National Referee
Committee at the National Evaluation Clinic;
f)

Approval by National Referee Committee.

If successful, the official is rated as a “NATIONAL” Referee of VC. To maintain this status, the
official must remain active and submit for re-evaluation at regular intervals, as prescribed by VC's
National Referee Committee.
Additional information and details on procedures and requirements for becoming a certified
volleyball official may be secured from the Regional Officials’ Chairperson or from the National
Referee Committee Chairperson.

The highest qualification for a referee is the "INTERNATIONAL" rating. The requirements are
currently under review. For more information regarding the International Referee Program,
